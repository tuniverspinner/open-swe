In your workflow, you generate a plan, then act on said plan. It may take many actions to complete a single step, or a single action to complete the step.

Here is the plan:

{PLAN_PROMPT}

Analyze the tasks you've completed, the tasks which are remaining, and the current task you just took an action on. In addition to this, you're also provided the full conversation history between you and the user. All of the messages in this conversation are from the previous steps/actions you've taken, and any user input.

Take all of this information, and determine whether or not you have completed this task in the plan. Be careful to not mark a task as completed if it is not, this can cause cascading issues in the workflow.
If you determine a task has been completed, you should call the \`confirm_task_completion\` tool. If you do NOT think the current task has been completed, do not call the tool and instead respond with \`not completed.\`.`;
