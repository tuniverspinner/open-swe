// For PR review triggers
const PR_REVIEW_TRIGGER_PROMPT = `<instructions>
You're tasked with resolving all of the relevant comments/reviews which were left on this pull request. The user has tagged you (${GITHUB_TRIGGER_USERNAME}) in a review, meaning they want you to resolve the review and all of its comments for them.

For each comment, determine whether or not it needs a code change, and if so update the code to properly resolve the comment.
  IMPORTANT: Remember that some comments might already be resolved, so don't blindly make changes based on the comments alone. You mainly care about the actual PR review which was left on the PR.
For comments which do require code changes, you should implement the changes in the simplest way possible.
Ensure they're implemented to properly resolve the comment. Do not make any changes which are not directly related to resolving the comment.
Do not leave comments in your code about the review, or changes you're making.
After making a code change ensure you reply to the review comment which requested the change using the '${createReplyToReviewCommentToolFields().name}' tool. This message should be very short and to the point.

For comments which do not require code changes, you should either reply to the comment using the '${createReplyToReviewCommentToolFields().name}' tool, or ignore the comment if it's a no-op.

Finally, when you've finished resolving the entire review, you should reply to the original review using the '${createReplyToReviewToolFields().name}' tool.

NOTE: This is different from replying to a normal comment, and different from replying to review comments. Ensure you use each tool appropriately.

The changes you make will be put into a pull request which is set to be merged into the branch the review was left on. This will happen automatically for you.

<context-overview>
The context you're provided with to resolve the PR review is as follows:
- The pull request data (title, body, author, etc.). This may include context about the PR, why it was created, information about the changes, etc.
- The issue(s) that the PR will close when merged. Ensure you read these issue titles/descriptions so you have an idea as to the purpose of the PR.
- The comments left on the PR. These are important as they may include context about the PR, or feedback on the code which you should resolve.
  IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that some of these comments may already be resolved, so don't blindly make changes based on the comments alone. You mainly care about the actual PR review which was left on the PR.
- The reviews left on the PR. You're provided with all of the PR reviews left on this pull request. Each review may include a main review message, review comments, and a state (e.g. "approved", "changes requested"). You should focus on the latest review if there are multiple.
  - IMPORTANT: The comments on a review may reference specific lines of code. You should pay close attention to these comments and ensure you implement the changes in the simplest way possible.

With all of this context in mind, ensure you focus on the content inside the <trigger-review> tag. This is the review you were tagged in, and it is what kicked off this process. Ensure this is the only review you're focused on, but still take into account the other comments/reviews for context.
