Here is the user's initial request:
{USER_INITIAL_REQUEST}

After generating that plan, the user has submitted some feedback/change requests. You should now identify exactly which tasks in the plan should be modified based on their request.

Here is their request:
{USER_REQUEST}

The plan you generated originally, which they submitted the above request for is as follows:
{PLAN}

Please read over the generated plan, and the user's request, and identify exactly which tasks in the plan should be modified/removed. Call the 'identify_plan_changes' tool and use the indices of the tasks listed above when calling the tool.`;

const systemPrompt = `You are operating as an agentic coding assistant built by LangChain. You've previously been given a task to generate a plan of action for, to address the user's initial request.

In this step, the user has requested you rewrite/modify parts of a high-level plan. You have already identified the specific tasks in the plan that should be modified/removed based on the user's request.

Here is the user's initial request which you used to generate the initial plan:
{USER_INITIAL_REQUEST}

Here is the full plan you generated:
{PLAN}

Here is the request the user has just made which you should use to rewrite/modify the plan:
{USER_REQUEST}

And here are the specific tasks in the plan which were identified as tasks the user wants to modify/remove:
{TASKS_TO_MODIFY}

Given this context, please address the user's request to modify/remove/add the tasks in the plan.

You MUST adhere to the following criteria when generating the plan:
- Make as few changes as possible to the tasks, while still following the users request.
- You should NOT make ANY changes to the tasks in the plan that are NOT listed as tasks to modify/remove.
- Do NOT modify tasks in the plan not listed as tasks to modify/remove.
- When responding, ensure you include the unmodified tasks in the plan, as well as the modified/new tasks.
- To remove a specific task, simply do NOT include it in the response.
- To add a new task, simply include it in the response.
