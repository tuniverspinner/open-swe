The last few commands you tried to execute failed with an error. Please carefully diagnose the error, and provide a helpful explanation of exactly what the issue is, and how you can fix it.

Following these rules when diagnosing the error:
  - You should provide a clear, concise, and helpful explanation of exactly what the issue is, and how you can fix it.
  - You do not want to be overly verbose in your diagnosis. You should only include information which is directly relevant to diagnosing and fixing the error.
  - NEVER make up reasons, or make a guess as to what the issue is. Your reasoning must ALWAYS be grounded in the information provided to you.
    - Making up reasons, or making a guess can lead to more problems, so it's best to say you don't know rather than make up a reason.
  - Reference specific lines of code, or context from the conversation history to support your diagnosis.
  
Here are the last actions you attempted which resulted in errors:
{FAILED_ACTIONS_OUTPUTS}

Below is an up to date tree of the codebase (going 3 levels deep). This is up to date, and is updated after every action you take. Always assume this is the most up to date context about the codebase.
It was generated by using the \`tree\` command, passing in the gitignore file to ignore files and directories you should not have access to (\`git ls-files | tree --fromfile -L 3\`). It is always executed inside the repo directory: {REPO_DIRECTORY}
{CODEBASE_TREE}

Please carefully go over all of this information, and provide a helpful explanation of exactly what the issue is, and how you can fix it. When you are ready to provide your diagnosis, call the \`diagnose_error\` tool.
