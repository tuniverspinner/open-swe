<context>{FOLLOWUP_MESSAGE_PROMPT}
You have already gathered comprehensive context from the repository through the conversation history below. All previous messages will be deleted after this planning step, so your plan must be self-contained and actionable without referring back to this context.
</context>

<task>
Generate an execution plan to address the user's request. Your plan will guide the implementation phase, so each action must be specific, actionable and detailed.
It should contain enough information to not require many additional context gathering steps to execute.

<user_request>
{USER_REQUEST_PROMPT}
</user_request>
</task>

<instructions>
Create your plan following these guidelines:

1. **Structure each action item to include:**
   - The specific task to accomplish
   - Key technical details needed for execution
   - File paths, function names, or other concrete references from the context you've gathered.
   - If you're mentioning a file, or code within a file that already exists, you are required to include the file path in the plan item.
    - This is incredibly important as we do not want to force the programmer to search for this information again, if you've already found it.

2. **Write actionable items that:**
   - Focus on implementation steps, not information gathering
   - Can be executed independently without additional context discovery
   - Build upon each other in logical sequence
   - Are not open ended, and require additional context to execute

3. **Optimize for efficiency by:**
   - Completing the request in the minimum number of steps. This is absolutely vital to the success of the plan. You should generate as few plan items as possible.
   - Reusing existing code and patterns wherever possible
   - Writing reusable components when code will be used multiple times

4. **Include only what's requested:**
   - Add testing steps only if the user explicitly requested tests
   - Add documentation steps only if the user explicitly requested documentation
   - Focus solely on fulfilling the stated requirements

5. **Follow the custom rules:**
   - Carefully read, and follow any instructions provided in the 'custom_rules' section. E.g. if the rules state you must run a linter or formatter, etc., include a plan item to do so.

6. **Combine simple, related steps:**
   - If you have multiple simple steps that are related, and should be executed one after the other, combine them into a single step.
   - For example, if you have multiple steps to run a linter, formatter, etc., combine them into a single step. The same goes for passing arguments, or editing files.
</instructions>

<output_format>
When ready, call the 'session_plan' tool with your plan. Each plan item should be a complete, self-contained action that can be executed without referring back to this conversation.

Structure your plan items as clear directives, for example:
- "Implement function X in file Y that performs Z using the existing pattern from file A"
- "Modify the authentication middleware in /src/auth.js to add rate limiting using the Express rate-limit package"

Always format your plan items with proper markdown. Avoid large headers, but you may use bold, italics, code blocks/inline code, and other markdown elements to make your plan items more readable.

Remember: Your goal is to create a focused, executable plan that efficiently accomplishes the user's request using the context you've already gathered.`;
